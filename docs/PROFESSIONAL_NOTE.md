# Important Note on Source Code Sharing

This repository contains a realistic enterprise project structure, but does not include full implementation details.

In professional environments, source code is intellectual property and should only be shared under:

- formal agreements,
- clear business context,
- proper licensing,
- and security considerations.

This project demonstrates structure, not internal logic.
